# 001. 80/20 Rule
#### aka: Pareto's Principle, Juran's Principle, and Vital Few and Trivial Many Rule
##### May 7, 2021

The 80/20 rule says that 20% of something in a system is responsible for 80% of something else (to put it generally). In 1896, [Vilfredo Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto) discovered approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population. Since then, [Joseph Juran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_M._Juran) applied Pareto's thought to management theory and garnered renown for this seemingly universal law. Lidwell, Holden, and Butler note that the 80/20 rule affects any large system; it is seen in business, economics, design, social science, and practically every other field.

## Non-digital example

According to the Center for Disease Control, 8 out of 10 COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have been people 65 years and older—that is, 16+% of the U.S. population (Center for Disease Control, n.d.; World Bank, 2020). In other words, ~20% of the population is subject to 80% of these deaths.

I suppose that this applies to any design, not just the digital type. In this quoted article, however, Indraksh takes the perspective of a digital UX designer and optimizing for the population that provides the majority of your traffic. **But wait. Accessibility who?** I must disagree with Indraksh to some degree—while it is impossible to design for every use case, it is imperative not to exclude. If you are designing for the 80% of use cases, don't forget about the 1 in 5 others!

The curve begins to plateau around 5 users or 30% of the total to find 85% of the usability problems.](NNGroup-user-testing-diminshing-returns-curve.gif)

Alternatively, Google's home page features the search bar prominently. While there are links to other services on the same page, *my guess* is that single search bar function contributes to the large majority of use cases for that page.

## 3D model

As inspired by Better Explained's article on the 80/20 rule, I aim to produce several objects at what I think might be "20% detail". The idea is that 20% detail (a sketch, essentially) can communicate the bulk of the goal. For the several objects, I will aim to create interior objects such as architectural structures, furniture, and other objects.
