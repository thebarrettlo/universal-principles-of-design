# Universal Principles of Design Example Series
by **Barrett Lo**  
*Conceived in 2021 during a global pandemic*

## üëãüèº Hello... *somebody*!
Hello, and welcome to the notes of my ambitious project of better understanding the Universal Principles of Design ([as named by William Lidwell, Kritina Holden, and Jill Butler](https://universalprinciplesofdesign.com/)). Through the deconstruction each of the 125 universal principles of design, I hope to become a more aware and substantiated designer (...unfortunately they did release a pocket edition that contains 150 principles, but I will be focused on the 125 for the time being).

In evaluating each principle, I plan to find additional reading on the principle, elevate one digital and one non-digital example, and create a related 3D scene in a 3D modeling software to practice my 3D modeling skills. While I am sure each principle could be dissected for weeks or months on end, time does not permit this survey of principles to dive deep.

## üÜï Updates
This section is reserved for updates to my original notes. Edit history will be present through GitHub; however, I will do my best to record updates and edits in this section for posterity.

## ‚è≤ Time allotment
With 125 different design principles to cover and limited time to commit to this project, I anticipate that at a minimum one principle will be evaluated per week. However, at this pace, I will complete the book in **more than two years**! Therefore... I need to make time for myself to work on this. How long does one principle take? I approximate...
```
   Research			30 minutes
+  Non-digital example		20 minutes
+  Digital example		20 minutes 
+  3D modeling			60 minutes
+  Mockup and post to SM	15 minutes
+  Copy to GitHub		5 minutes
__________________________________________
=				2.5 hours
```
... per principle. Can I commit to this? To work through all 125 principles, I need to complete *at minimum* 2 principles per week, if not more. This would add up to 5+ hours per week on this passion project.

## üòµ Potential variables
As I am writing this on April 9th, 2021‚Äîbefore I have attempted any of these 125 features‚ÄîI estimated the times above. These may vary, particularly the 3D modeling portion as I become more comfortable with the software, I may work faster. Another note is that the 3D modeling time assumes the modeling AND the rendering (or doesn't account for the rendering time); rendering may substantially increase the total time if unable to accomplish other tasks at the same time.
